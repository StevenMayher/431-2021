# 431 Class 02: 2021-08-26

- This is the README for Class 02 of Professor Love's 431 course for Fall 2021. The main website is https://thomaselove.github.io/431/.
- Each class' README serves as a **starting point**. Get here through the link on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).

## Today's Opener: The Quick Survey

As you come in, you will receive a paper survey with 15 questions. Please read these instructions carefully before writing anything down.

1. Introduce yourself to someone near you.
2. Record the survey answers **for that other person**, while they record your responses.
3. Be sure to complete all 15 questions (both sides of the paper).
4. When you are finished, thank your partner and raise your hand. Someone will come around to collect your survey.

There is a [PDF copy of the Quick Survey here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class02/431_quick_survey_2021-08-26.pdf), if you'd like to look at the form after your paper copy has been collected.

## Today's Slides

- Class 02 slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class02/431-class02-slides.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class02/431-class02-slides.Rmd), so you can see how I built them.

## Today's Announcements

1. Each class is recorded. The Class 01 recording is available on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) through Modules, or you can view (and, I believe, download) it on the Zoom link provided in our Shared Google Drive. Recordings of each class should be posted the next morning. If you have problems accessing the recordings, let us know about it on [Piazza](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/).

2. There is an R package and set of tools developed by Stephanie Spielman and colleagues called the [introverse](https://spielmanlab.github.io/introverse/articles/introverse_online.html) which is another way to get some help with basic ideas in R and the tidyverse that we'll be discussing through the semester. Here's a [quote from the introverse's page on Github](https://spielmanlab.github.io/introverse/index.html):

> The [introverse package](https://spielmanlab.github.io/introverse/index.html) provides alternate documentation for commonly-used functions and concepts in Base R and in the tidyverse. The provided resources are meant to complement, not replace official documentation and existing R resources. Therefore, the goal of the introverse is to provide beginner-oriented help for most introductory topics within R and the tidyverse, not to provide comprehensive help about using all of R. We hope introverse can help you (and/or your students!) get up-and-running within R and the tidyverse, so that once you get your bearings you can eventually “graduate” from the introverse and take advantage of the official comprehensive documentation/resources.

3. Our [Software Tutorials page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/software/README.md) links to lots of useful resources like the introverse, and we recommend you take some time this weekend to get R installed and start getting up to speed.
