# 431 Class 02: 2021-08-26

- This is the README for Class 02 of Professor Love's 431 course for Fall 2021. The main website is https://thomaselove.github.io/431/.
- Each class' README serves as a **starting point**. Get here through the link on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).

## Today's Slides

- Class 02 slides will be posted in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class01/431-class01-slides.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class01/431-class01-slides.Rmd), so you can see how I built them.

## Today's Announcements

1. Each class is recorded. The Class 01 recording is available on Canvas through Modules, or you can view (and, I believe, download) it on the Zoom link I've provided in our Shared Google Drive. Recordings of each class should be posted the next morning during the semester. If you have problems accessing the recordings, let us know about it on [Piazza](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/).
