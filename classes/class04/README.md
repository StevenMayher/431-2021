## What should I be working on between now and Class 05 on Tuesday 2021-09-07?

1. Make sure you complete [Lab 01](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs) by the deadline, which is **Monday 2021-09-06 at 9 PM**. Be sure to submit all items through [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) as requested.
2. Be certain you've read through the entire [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/) before noon on Sunday 2021-09-05 so that you understand what's ahead of you. Take a look at the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html), too, so you aren't surprised by deadlines.
3. Read Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics* at least through Chapter 1. I'd also recommend looking at the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) through Chapter 7.
4. Make sure you have worked through each of [the five software installation steps discussed here](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/software_install.html).
5. Be sure you are properly signed up on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431) and that you're reviewing the conversations going on there.
6. Now would be a good time to review sections 1-4 and 15 from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and link up the ideas presented there with what Dr. Love shared with you in the [Class 03 recording](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/classes/class03).
7. [Lab 02](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/lab02) is due 2021-09-20. You might want to get started on it.
8. Visit [TA office hours](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/contact.html) if you have any questions, or ask your questions on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431). We want to help you!
