## Today's Slides

- Dr. Love's slides are now available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class16/431-class16-slides.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class16/431-class16-slides.Rmd).
- The recording will be made available approximately 24 hours after class through our Shared Google Drive and via Modules and Echo 360 on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Announcements

1. Remember that we do not have class on Tuesday 2021-10-19, because of CWRU Fall Break. Our next class, Class 17, will be one week from today, on 2021-10-21.
2. Feedback on the [Minute Paper after Class 15](https://bit.ly/431-2021-min15-feedback) is now available. The next Minute Paper will be after Class 18.
3. On Tuesday, we updated [Lab 5 (Question 4)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/lab05) to fix a typo. I'm also pushing the deadline back from Monday 2021-10-18 at 9 PM to Thursday 2021-10-21 at 9 PM, with the caveat that we will only accept late work on Lab 5 that arrives by 9:59 PM next Thursday (within 1 hour of this new deadline.)
4. I posted a [hint on Piazza last night](https://piazza.com/class/kseogqdhsbk1cr?cid=118) in response to Question 118 about Lab 5, questions 1 and 2.
5. Another [Piazza highlight](https://piazza.com/class/kseogqdhsbk1cr?cid=116) was Question 116, where I discussed how I might generate a random ID for participant de-identification in a simple setting.
6. On Tuesday, we updated the [slides from Class 15](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/classes/class15) to fix an error in slide 32, in the discussion of what option f implied.
7. The (simulated) data set we'll use in today's class, called `nicu_seq.xls` is available in [the data folder for this class](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/classes/class16/data), as well as in the [431-data repository](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data). The motivating study is [Effect of Whole-Genome Sequencing on the Clinical Management of Acutely Ill Infants With Suspected Genetic Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class16/NICUseq_Study_JAMA_Peds_2021-09-27.pdf) from The NICUSEq Study Group, *JAMA Pediatrics* [published online 2021-09-22](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2784261).
8. New data on favorite movies will be posted over Fall Break, and we'll return to them in Class 17 (2021-10-21) if possible.

## Project A proposals 

The [list of proposals](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/projectA/proposals.md) now includes information about whether or not your proposal was accepted. 

- All 44 projects are now fully reviewed, and comments have been provided to all project proposals on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).
- Several of the Teaching Assistants did an immense amount of work on an extremely tight deadline to get this done. THANK YOU!
- Those of you who still need to revise should find details on that process in [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/lab05) is now due on Thursday 2021-10-21 at 9 PM. We won't accept work that's more than an hour late, in light of this change.
2. You'll want to have read Spiegelhalter through Chapter 8 by the time you take [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/quizzes), which will be available on Friday 2021-10-22.
3. Your [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/) (Proposal, if revision is required, and then Analyses.) Remember Project A is due 2021-11-01. 
  - There are lots of opportunities to *supplement* the suggested analyses in Project A. You are welcome to do that, but (1) don't neglect doing the things we've specifically asked you to do, and (2) don't put things in that don't add meaningful value. Too much is not a good thing.
  - Running the R code effectively is just the start of what we care about - it's a minimum standard. A major part of what separates an outstanding project from a good one is someone making clear, well-reasoned choices about what analytic material (and interpretations of that material) to include. Including useless stuff will lead to a lower grade. Including clearly useful stuff will not, and might help. We are looking to you to see whether you can do this or not.Â 

Remember that we do not have class next Tuesday.


## One Last Thing

The holiday is still a couple of weeks away, but you may be interested in [The Ultimate Halloween Candy Power Ranking](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/) from Walt Hickey and the good folks at FiveThirtyEight. The original post is now five years old, but it's still a really enjoyable piece, accompanied by a video describing the methods and conclusions.
