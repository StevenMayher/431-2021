- The recording will be made available approximately 24 hours after class through our Shared Google Drive and via Modules and Echo 360 on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Announcements

1. Did you know that the [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) have a search function?
2. Results from the Minute Paper after Class 18 [are now available](https://bit.ly/431-2021-min18-feedback).
3. The [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/quizzes/quiz2) Answer Sketch and Results document [is now available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/quizzes/quiz2/quiz2_sketch_with_results.pdf).
    - Dr. Love emailed you details on your performance on Quiz 2 last night or this morning. If you didn't get them, please email him ASAP.
    - If you have complaints or questions about Quiz 2 grading, please submit them via email to Dr. Love anytime **after** today's class.
4. We made a mistake in grading Question 9 in Lab 5 (not allowing students to prepare a 2x2 table in either appropriate way) and have now fixed it. [Details here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/lab05).
    - The affected students received an email from Dr. Love about this on 2021-10-27. We have updated the feedback and scores on the [Course Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades) for Lab 5.
    - The [Lab 5 Answer Sketch and Grading Rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/lab05) is now updated, too.
5. [Here's all of the Project B information](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/projectB/teaser.md) I have at the moment.
    - You will have complete instructions for Project B by class time on Thursday 2021-11-04.
6. Again, there's a [new version of RStudio available](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 
    - I suggest upgrading **after** you turn in Project A. One change is that RStudio has changed to calendar versioning, so the new version number is something like `2021.09.0+351` for RStudio. The version of R we're using is `R 4.1.1`.

## Project A Final Weekend: Everything is due Tuesday 2021-11-02 at 9 PM. Good luck!

- [Here is an R Markdown file of the Sample Project A Analyses](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class19/dm1_sample_projA_analyses.Rmd) that I will discuss today, using the `dm1` data. The purpose of this example is to assure people that they've done the minimum things required. Most projects should do a better job than this small example does.
- https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/dm1_projA contains the HTML result obtained using that HTML file.

## One Last Thing

**On Asking Questions**: We know it can be difficult to ask for help, and while we try to be helpful in responding on Piazza, over Zoom office hours, via email or through the Minute Papers, if we don't understand your question (or don't understand the purpose of it) we can often confuse matters. Moreover, if we think you already know something when you don't, that can also get in the way of giving you a useful response. 

Our goal is to understand what you're asking and help you, however we can. Please help us help you by being as specific as you can about where you're having trouble when you ask a question, and be persistent - we want to help you, really! We are, in fact, very grateful for every question we receive.

## A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder

- The musical I am performing in opens at Aurora Community Theatre tomorrow evening, 2021-10-29 and continues on the weekends through 2021-11-20. A message like this will appear on the bottom of the next few READMEs until the show is over. 
- If you are interested, visit https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater for more details. 
- If you are not interested, then I thank you for your patience. Let me just emphasize again that coming or not coming to the show will have no impact on your grade in this course, at all.
- Aurora Community Theatre requires proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test from within 72 hours of the performance date and time for entry. An image on your phone is acceptable. This precaution will be required of everyone entering the theatre. In addition masks also will be required inside the building, lobby, and all public spaces.
