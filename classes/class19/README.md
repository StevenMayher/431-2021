## Today's Slides

- We will continue with the slides originally presented in Class 18. Dr. Love's slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class19/431-class18-slides.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class19/431-class18-slides.Rmd). 
- The recording will be made available approximately 24 hours after class through our Shared Google Drive and via Modules and Echo 360 on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Announcements

1. Results from the Minute Paper after Class 18 are **to come**.
2. The [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/quizzes/quiz2) Answer Sketch and Results document [is now available in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/quizzes/quiz2/quiz2_sketch_with_results.pdf).
    - Dr. Love will email you details on your performance on Quiz 2 **before class time Thursday**.
    - If you have complaints or questions about Quiz 2 grading, please submit them via email to Dr. Love **after** Thursday's class.
3. We made a mistake in grading Question 9 in Lab 5 (not allowing students to prepare a 2x2 table in either appropriate way) and have now fixed it. [Details here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/lab05).
    - The affected students received an email from Dr. Love about this on 2021-10-27. We have updated the feedback and scores on the [Course Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades) for Lab 5.
    - The [Lab 5 Answer Sketch and Grading Rubric](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/lab05) is now updated, too.
4. Again, there's a [new version of RStudio available](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). 
    - I suggest upgrading **after** you turn in Project A. One change is that RStudio has changed to calendar versioning, so the new version number is something like `2021.09.0+351` for RStudio. The version of R we're using is `R 4.1.1`.
5. Some Project B information **to come**.

## Project A Final Weekend: Reminders

1. Deadline: Tuesday 2021-11-02 at 9 PM.

## One Last Thing

## A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder

- The musical I am performing in opens at Aurora Community Theatre tomorrow evening, 2021-10-29 and continues on the weekends through 2021-11-20. A message like this will appear on the bottom of the next few READMEs until the show is over. 
- If you are interested, visit https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater for more details. 
- If you are not interested, then I thank you for your patience. Let me just emphasize again that coming or not coming to the show will have no impact on your grade in this course, at all.
- Aurora Community Theatre requires proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test from within 72 hours of the performance date and time for entry. An image on your phone is acceptable. This precaution will be required of everyone entering the theatre. In addition masks also will be required inside the building, lobby, and all public spaces.
