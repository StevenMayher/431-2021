## Announcements

1. Results from the Minute Paper after Class 18 are to come.

## A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder

- The musical I am performing in opens at Aurora Community Theatre tomorrow evening, 2021-10-29 and continues on the weekends through 2021-11-20. A message like this will appear on the bottom of the next few READMEs until the show is over. 
- If you are interested, visit https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater for more details. 
- If you are not interested, then I thank you for your patience. Let me just emphasize again that coming or not coming to the show will have no impact on your grade in this course, at all.
- Aurora Community Theatre requires proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test from within 72 hours of the performance date and time for entry. An image on your phone is acceptable. This precaution will be required of everyone entering the theatre. In addition masks also will be required inside the building, lobby, and all public spaces.
