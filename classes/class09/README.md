## Today's Slides

- Dr. Love's slides **will be available** in [PDF format], as well as in [R Markdown].
- The recording will be made available approximately 24 hours after class through our Shared Google Drive and via Modules and Echo 360 on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Announcements

1. An Answer Sketch and Grading Rubric for Lab 2 **will be posted** by class time.
2. As announced via Piazza, some Sample Essays from [Lab 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/lab01) (questions 2, 3 and 4) that we liked are available to you on our Shared Google Drive in the **431 Lab 1 Essay Examples** document.
3. One of the things we did in the [Movies breakout for Class 8](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/breakout1.md) was ask you to poll your group, and see what film was the first one (alphabetically) that you'd all seen. 
    - I wound up with reports from eleven groups, containing 2 to 6 students.
        - Seven of those 11 groups wound up at film **#4: Avatar**.
        - Another group (6 people: The Locker) had to move down to **#5. Avengers: Endgame**.
        - The "7 people" group (which actually had 6 people) went down to **#21. The Dark Knight**.
        - "The Outliers" had to go even further, down to **#47. Home Alone**.
        - But this paled in comparison to "Group 1" (with 6 people) that had to go all the way down to **#105. Titanic**.
    - Can we estimate the probability that **any** of [the 115 films](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/movies_list.md) will have been seen by everyone in the room?

3. **Project A proposal** As the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) indicates, the main deadline for the Project A Proposal is not until Monday 2021-10-11, but we strongly encourage submissions prior to noon on Friday 2021-10-01, via the appropriate Assignment on Canvas.
    - Use the [Project A Proposal Example](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/exampleA.html) as a template for your work.
    - Visit the [Class 08 README](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/classes/class08#project-a-getting-started) for some tips on [Getting Started with Project A](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/classes/class08#project-a-getting-started).
    - The TAs and I will review all early proposals quickly (by 2021-10-06) and either accept them as is, or provide guidance as to what needs to be repaired by 2021-10-11 so as to receive full credit.
4. **Quiz 1 sample questions** I [prepared a document](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/quizzes/README.md#sample-quiz-five-old-quiz-questions) containing five old quiz questions, as well as an answer sketch for those five questions, and some information on results.
