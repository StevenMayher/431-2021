- The recording will be made available approximately 24 hours after class through our Shared Google Drive and via Modules and Echo 360 on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Announcements

1. Remember that Lab 5 is due at 9 PM tonight, 2021-10-21. An answer sketch will be posted by 9 AM Friday morning.
2. Quiz 2 will be available to you by noon Friday 2021-10-22. 
    - Piazza will switch to private posts only at noon Friday and remain in that mode until Tuesday morning 2021-10-26.
    - During the Quiz, you can only get answers to questions about the Quiz via Piazza private posts, or emails to 431-help.
    - TA Office Hours (for support on the projects, in particular) will be held, as usual, throughout the Quiz window.
3. Project A is due on 2021-11-01.
    - A major goal of mine is to ensure that all of you have what you need to complete Project A when this class session concludes.
4. I added the `pwr` package to the [list of packages we recommend you install in R](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/r_packages.html). Now would be an excellent time to update your packages, and if you're not already using R version 4.1.1., we encourage you to upgrade.
5. Our next Minute Paper will be after Class 18. If you wish to share anything with Dr. Love, specifically, email is always open.

## One Last Thing
