## Announcements

1. Remember that [Lab 5](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/lab05) is due at 9 PM tonight, 2021-10-21. An answer sketch will be posted by 9 AM Friday morning.
    - We fixed a couple of typos in the lab over the break. None should affect your conclusions.
    - The choice of `acutemi` as an outcome in Part B (questions 7-8) of Lab 5 was an odd choice on our part. We wrote about it in response to [Question 124 on Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kseogqdhsbk1cr?cid=124).
3. Grades and Feedback on Labs 1-4 and Minute Papers through Class 15 are available on the [Course Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades).
4. Sample Responses to Questions 1-5 on Lab 4 are available on our Shared Google Drive in the **431 Lab 4 Examples** document.
5. [Quiz 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/quizzes/quiz2) will be available to you [at this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/quizzes/quiz2) by noon Friday 2021-10-22.  
    - The Google Form for submitting your responses is due **note revised deadline** at **11 PM** on Monday 2021-10-25.
    - Piazza will switch to private posts only at noon Friday and remain in that mode until Tuesday morning 2021-10-26.
    - During the Quiz, you can only get answers to questions about the Quiz via Piazza private posts, or emails to 431-help.
    - TA Office Hours (for support on the projects, in particular) will be held, as usual, throughout the Quiz window.
6. [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/) is due on 2021-11-01.
    - The [list of proposals is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/projectA/proposals.md) and this now includes some trivia on the states and variables that were most commonly selected.
    - We will use some of today's class time to ensure that you have what you need to complete Project A.
    - I updated the [Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/) lightly on 2021-10-18. The main change is to announce that the Project A Self-Evaluation Google Form is now available at https://bit.ly/431-2021-projA-self-evaluation.
7. I posted to our Shared Google Drive a newly edited and substantially augmented [data set about favorite movies](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/README.md#new-and-amplified-data-set).
    - The previous version of the data (from 2021-09-13) included 14 variables. 
    - The new version ([431_favorite_movies_2021-10-16](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1t4668vGN-97284uWbH154LQHmj8p90hkIlafPOjnIcQ/edit?usp=sharing)) corrects some errors, and now contains 69 variables on each of the 115 movies identified by students in 431 this year and last.
8. I added the `pwr` package to the [list of packages we recommend you install in R](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/r_packages.html). Now would be an excellent time to update your packages, and if you're not already using R version 4.1.1., we encourage you to upgrade.
9. Our next [Minute Paper](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/minutepapers) will be after Class 18. If you wish to share anything with Dr. Love, specifically, email is always open.
