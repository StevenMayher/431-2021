## One Last Thing

During the year, I'll occasionally use this space to share an interesting graphic or interactive tool for understanding or exploring some data. Today, we'll take a moment to look at [Bitcoin Uses More Electricity Than Many Countries. How Is That Possible?](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html) from The New York Times, 2021-09-03. The article is by Jon Huang, Claire Oâ€™Neill and Hiroko Tabuchi with illustrations by Eliana Rodgers.
