## Announcements

1. There will be a Minute Paper after Class 07 due Wednesday 2021-09-15 at noon. Details to come.
2. I fixed small typos in the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) and [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/) this past weekend. If you find things, tell us about them via [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431).
3. By class time, you should have received your **Lab Code** in an email from Dr. Love (sent 2021-09-10, subject is **431 Lab Code - please save**.) 
    - Use the Lab Code to review our reactions to your work in the [Course Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades).
    - You'll need to log into Google via CWRU to see the [Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades).
    - If you haven't received your 431 Lab Code, check your email again, and then contact Dr. Love directly for a replacement.
4. By class time, the [Course Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades) will include your grade on the Minute Paper after Class 05 and our feedback on Lab 01. 
    - If you have a question about the **substance** of Lab 1 (or any Lab), please ask it on Piazza or in TA office hours.
    - If you have a concern about **your grade** on Lab 1 (or any later Lab), don't ask it in the normal ways, but instead [follow the instructions here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs#grading-errors-and-regrade-requests) regarding grading errors and regrade requests.
