## Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 07](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/minutepapers) due Wednesday 2021-09-15 at noon. 
2. I fixed small typos in the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) and [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/) and [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) this past weekend. If you find things, tell us about them via [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431), using the `typos` label.
3. You should have received your **Lab Code** in an email from Dr. Love (sent 2021-09-10, subject is **431 Lab Code - please save**.) 
    - Use the Lab Code to review our reactions to your work in the [Course Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades).
    - You'll need to log into Google via CWRU to see the [Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades).
    - If you haven't received your 431 Lab Code, contact Dr. Love via email today for a replacement.
4. The [Course Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades) now includes our feedback on Lab 01. This comes from the TAs and Dr. Love.
    - If you have a question about the **substance** of Lab 1 (or any Lab), please ask it on Piazza or in TA office hours.
    - If you have a concern about **your grade** on Lab 1 (or any later Lab), don't ask it in the normal ways, but instead [follow the instructions here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs#grading-errors-and-regrade-requests) regarding grading errors and regrade requests.
    - Those of you scoring below 85 on this Lab, that is a concern. Make it your business to be clearer on what needs to be done (and meet all deadlines) for Lab 2. TA office hours continue every day of the week except Tuesday, and Piazza is always available. 
    - We'll also remind you that we did not deduct points for problems with English grammar and syntax in Lab 1, although we flagged some issues in the Comments. Starting with Lab 2, grammar and syntax are important parts of your grade on all work in 431. If you need help in this regard, get it.
5. A data set describing your favorite movies (and those from last year's students) is now available to you. We'll discuss this further on Thursday, but I am asking a couple of questions related to this on the [Minute Paper](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/minutepapers) - specifically, I'm asking whether or not you've seen 20 of the movies on the list. I expect to eventually ask you about all 115.
