## Project A

We'll be discussing the Project A instructions today, which have [a website of their own](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/). 

- Your immediate focus should be on the [Proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/proposal.html) (that you'll do in September) and you'll want to look closely at the [Data page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/data.html) which describes the data you will be using.
- The Examples & Tips pages contain information on samples and tips we’ve prepared to help you find your way through Project A, including a [sample proposal](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/exampleA.html) that you'll use as a model for your work in the rest of September.
- In October, you'll move from the fundamental work with the data and the proposal towards a final portfolio of materials, which we'll discuss further in a few weeks.
    - The [Analyses page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/analyses.html) contains information on the analyses you’ll need to include in your final submission after completing the development of your data frame.
    - The [Final Report page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/final.html) describes the three elements of the final submission (the report, the video and the self-evaluation) that you will build in October and provides submission instructions.
