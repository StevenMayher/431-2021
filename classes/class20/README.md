## A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder

- The musical I am performing in continues at Aurora Community Theatre, in Aurora, OH on the weekends through 2021-11-20. A message like this will appear on the bottom of the next few READMEs until the show is over. Aurora Community Theatre requires proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test from within 72 hours of the performance date and time for entry. An image on your phone is acceptable. This precaution will be required of everyone entering the theatre. In addition masks also will be required inside the building, lobby, and all public spaces. If you are interested, visit https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater for more details. If you are not interested, then I thank you for your patience. Let me just emphasize again that coming or not coming to the show will have no impact on your grade in this course, at all.
