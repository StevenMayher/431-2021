# 431 Materials After Class 26

## Remaining Tasks

1. Project B Presentations can now be done either via Zoom or in person. Just visit https://bit.ly/431-2021-projectB-zoom-or-in-person as spoon as possible, and at any rate before 7 AM on the day of your presentation to let me know which you've decided. 
    - My default assumption is that you will be doing your presentation **in person**, so if that's your plan, arrive at my office (Wood WG-82J) on the ground floor of the Wood building at the School of Medicine at the time listed on the schedule (see our Shared Drive.) 
        - When you arrive outside my office, do not knock on the door, so as not to disturb the previous group. 
        - I will open the door when I am available. Contact me via email if there is an emergency on the day of your presentation.
    - If instead you decide to do your presentation **via Zoom**, you will receive the Zoom link from me on the day of your presentation by 9 AM.
    - If you are working with a partner, you either need to meet with me together in person, or join the Zoom option together. You can't do one person on Zoom and one person "in person".

## Updates to Materials since our Last Class

1. I changed the **deadline** for the optional Labs X, Y and Z to MONDAY 2021-12-13 at noon. This change is now in place on the Calendar, the Class 26 README, and in the descriptions of the labs, and on Canvas.
2. The recording for Class 26 is posted, and I have also created a 10-minute recording for Class 25 (since that recording wasn't made) which walks through some of the highlights of that session. You'll find the links on our Shared Drive.
3. I fixed a typo in the checklist as part of the Project B instructions.
4. I updated the Minute Paper after Class 25 feedback on our Shared Drive to incorporate a couple of changes I hadn't gotten into the copy you were seeing.
