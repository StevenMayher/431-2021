# 431 Materials After Class 26

## Remaining Tasks

1. Project B Presentations can now be done either via Zoom or in person. Just visit https://bit.ly/431-2021-projectB-zoom-or-in-person as soon as possible to let me know. The deadline for [completing that form](https://bit.ly/431-2021-projectB-zoom-or-in-person) is 7 AM on the day of your presentation.
    - If you will be doing your presentation **in person**, arrive at my office (Wood WG-82J) on the ground floor of the Wood building at the School of Medicine at the time listed on the schedule (see our Shared Drive.) When you arrive outside my office, do not knock on the door, so as not to disturb the previous group. I will open the door when I am available.
    - If instead you decide to do your presentation **via Zoom**, you will receive the Zoom link from me on the day of your presentation by 9 AM, if you have completed the form. 
    - If you are working with a partner, you either need to meet with me together in person, or join the Zoom option together. You can't do one person on Zoom and one person "in person".
2. Due at NOON on Friday 2021-12-10
    - Final [Project B](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectB/) materials.
        - This includes R Markdown and HTML files for Study 1 and for Study 2, submitted through [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/)
        - All students must also complete the [Self-Evaluation Form](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectB/self_eval.html), which will be posted to that link before Monday 2021-12-06.
        - If you are not using NHANES 2017-18 data, you will also need to submit your raw data through [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/)
        - If you built slides for your oral presentation, submit those through [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/) too.
    - Optional [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-2021-lab-regrade-requests) (see [details here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs#grading-errors-and-regrade-requests) and in [this section of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/deliverables-assignments.html#appeal-policy---request-a-review-in-december))
3. The three optional Labs are now due at **NOON on Monday 2021-12-13**
    - Optional [Lab X](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/labX) (your website; thanks to the folks who've already done this)
    - Optional [Lab Y](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/labY) (visualizing the [amplified (2021-10-16) favorite movies data set](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/classes/movies#new-and-amplified-data-set) in a graph)
    - Optional [Lab Z](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/labZ) (building a table [with the gt package](https://gt.rstudio.com/) for the [movies data](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/classes/movies#new-and-amplified-data-set))
4. Your CWRU Course Evaluation for 431 is due by midnight on Wednesday December 15. Take it any time at https://webapps.case.edu/courseevals/, although I'd prefer that you wait to do this until **after** your project presentation. 

## Updates to Materials since our Last Class

1. I changed the **deadline** for the optional Labs X, Y and Z to MONDAY 2021-12-13 at noon. This change is now in place on the Calendar, the Class 26 README, and in the descriptions of the labs, and on Canvas.
2. The recording for Class 26 is posted, and I have also created a 10-minute recording for Class 25 (since that recording wasn't made) which walks through some of the highlights of that session. You'll find the links on our Shared Drive.
3. I fixed a typo in the checklist as part of the Project B instructions.
4. I updated the Minute Paper after Class 25 feedback on our Shared Drive to incorporate a couple of changes I hadn't gotten into the copy you were seeing.
