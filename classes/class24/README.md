## References Associated with This Week's Material

Today's class will continue our presentation on replicable research, statistical significance and *p* values. 

Key references include [the 2019 American Statistical Association editorial](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class23/references/ASA_2019_A_World_Beyond.pdf):

- Ronald L. Wasserstein, Allen L. Schirm & Nicole A. Lazar (2019) [Moving to a World Beyond "p < 0.05"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913), *The American Statistician*, 73:sup1, 1-19, DOI: [10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2019.1583913). 
    - Ron gave a [one-hour talk you can watch here](https://t.co/GbQF01h4jU) on "[Helping to move to a world beyond p < 0.05](https://t.co/GbQF01h4jU)" which I cannot recommend enough.

You may also be interested in [the American Statistical Association's 2016 statement on P Values](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class23/references/ASA_2016_Pvalues_Context_Process_Purpose.pdf) which originally got me thinking along these lines: 

- Ronald L. Wasserstein & Nicole A. Lazar (2016) [The ASA's Statement on p-Values: Context, Process, and Purpose](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108), *The American Statistician*, 70:2, 129-133, DOI:
[10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108).

Two resources for learning more after today's talk are:

- Frank E. Harrell's [A Litany of Problems with *p*-values](https://www.fharrell.com/post/pval-litany/) blog post most recently updated in 2020.
- William Briggs' [Everything Wrong with P-values Under One Roof](http://wmbriggs.com/post/26125/) which links to a detailed article on the subject.

Three other articles I'll be talking about eventually:

- Jeffrey Leek and Roger Peng [P-values are just the tip of the iceberg](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class23/references/Leek_and_Peng_2015_Pvalues_Nature.pdf)
- Jeffrey D Blume, Lucy D'Agostino McGowan, William D. Dupont, Robert A Greevy [Second-generation p values: Improved rigor, reproducibility and transparency in statistical analyses](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class23/references/Blume_etal_2018_Second_Generation_P_Values.pdf)
- Andrew Gelman and John Carlin [Beyond Power Calculations: Assessing Type S (Sign) and Type M (Magnitude) Errors](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class23/references/Gelman_Carlin_2014_Beyond_Power_Calculations.pdf)

Some related motivation comes from 

- [Scientists rise up against statistical significance](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9) in *Nature* 2019-03-20
- [It's time to talk about ditching statistical significance](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00874-8) also in *Nature* 2019-03-19.
- Briggs, William M., 2019. [Everything Wrong with P-Values Under One Roof](http://wmbriggs.com/post/26125/). In Beyond Traditional Probabilistic Methods in Economics, V Kreinovich, NN Thach, ND Trung, DV Thanh (eds.), pp 22â€“44. DOI 978-3-030-04200-4_2

We'll spend a bit of time talking about:

- the "PROBABLE CAUSE" graphic reprinted in this [Nature piece by Regina Nuzzo](https://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700), originally from T. Sellke et al. in *The American Statistician*, 2001.
- and several great pieces by Christie Aschwanden at 538:
    - "[Not Even Scientists Can Easily Explain P-Values](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/not-even-scientists-can-easily-explain-p-values/)", and
    - "[Statisticians Found One Thing They Can Agree On: It's Time To Stop Misusing P-values](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/statisticians-found-one-thing-they-can-agree-on-its-time-to-stop-misusing-p-values/)", and
    - "[Science Isn't Broken](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/#part1)" with graphics by Ritchie King.
- You may also be interested in this piece at pbs.org about a NOVA program entitled "[Rethinking Science's Magic Number](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/rethinking-sciences-magic-number/)".
- I have given several talks on "Rethinking Statistical Significance" in recent years. The Github repository for one (90 minutes at MetroHealth Medical Center and the Center for Health Care Research and Policy, with an audio recording) is at https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/rethink, if you're a glutton for punishment.
- [Why p values are like puppies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jW9G8MO4PQ) is a 3:29 YouTube Video by Cassie Kozyrkov, MS, Chief Decision Scientist, Google Inc. It explains how to understand and interpret *p* values in an intuitive way using an example based on puppies.
