## Project A Early Proposals and Some Thoughts on Titles

We received early proposals from the following 12 groups. A "real" title would not contain 431, or Project A or Proposal in it, at least, and it should also make sense to the reader. A good title for this project is also no more than 120 characters long (ideally less than 80), including spaces and/or punctuation.

- Grace Armstrong and Kiran Desai "Environmental Factors and their Impact on Life Expectancy"
- Abigail Basson and Alise Carlson "The relationship between unemployment, violent crime, excessive alcohol consumption, food environment, and life expectancy in four neighboring states" which is way too long.
- Avantika Bhaduri and Anushree Iyengar "Factors Affecting Poor Physical Health Days in the United States" which is far too broad and needs focus.
- Erika Hutt Centeno and Alan Kiang "Predictors of Influenza Vaccination Rates" which could have a little more detail, although I like the focus on an outcome.
- Jeeda Ismail and Makaela Mews "Assessment of factors potentially influencing Poor Mental Health Days across geographical regions within the United States" which is too long, and needs some focus.
- Ben Kramer and Jacqueline Shaia "Social determinents of health association with life expectancy" which doesn't really work grammatically.
- Nick Latina and Kristi Lin-Rahardja, who need a real title.
- Harrison Lindley and Sarah Nock "EXPLORING POTENTIAL CORRELATES OF SUICIDE AND POOR MENTAL HEALTH AT THE COUNTY LEVEL ACROSS FIVE STATES" which should be presented in Title Case. Otherwise, you're shouting. I would also avoid "potential correlates" as a phrase.
- Norman Luc and Shruti Raghunathan, who need a real title.
- Carly Rose and Diya Yang, who also need a real title.
- Ying Xiong and Audrey Zhu "Investigating Median Household Income and Potential Influencing Factors in Six States from the 2021 County Health Rankings Dataset" which is also longer than it should be.
- Modong Yang and Ziyin Zhao "The influence of unemployment, some college, food insecurity and income inequality on violent crime in counties in Midwest states" which is also too long, and needs some focus.

and from the following 23 individuals:

- Allison Bode "Effect of smoking, food insecurity, sleep, and diabetes on adult obesity rate in Ohio, California, Florida, and North Carolina"
- Michael Douglass "Does Educating our Youth Have Anything to Do with Our Happiness?"
- Megan Foradori "Comparing Care and Characteristics of Pregnant Mothers and Newborns in Selected US Counties"
- Katie Heinzinger "Predictors of Violent Crime from the 2021 County Health Rankings" which could use some focus.
- Kyaw Oo Hla, who needs a real title.
- Zahin Islam "INVESTIGATING FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE MOTOR VEHICLE CRASH DEATHS" which should be presented in Title Case. Otherwise, you're shouting. Also it needs to be more specific, I think, about the types of "factors".
- Chris Jones, who needs a real title.
- Owen LaFramboise "Effects of Numbers of Physicians on Health Behaviors in Democratic-Voting States" which is fine except I'd drop the "Effects of Numbers of" in favor of a tighter construction
- Gen Li, who needs a real title.
- Rock Lim, who also needs a real title.
- Ryan McMaster "How Exposure to Binge Drinking Effects At-Risk Children" which is ambitious, but that can be OK if you avoid making causal statements based on cross-sectional aggregated data.
- Luis Mesias Flores "The Relationship between Educational Predictors and Unemployment" which probably needs to be amplified a bit.
- Cerag Oguztuzun, who needs a real title.
- Alex Olejko "Predicting Math Scores Using Environmental Variables" which could use a little focus on the predictors.
- Thomas Raffay, who needs a real title.
- Himani Sancheti "Frequent Mental Health Distress Across Six Selected States in the US" which could be shortened a bit to bring in a predictor group, perhaps.
- Maryssa Shanteau-Jackson "Analysis of Factors Contributing to Premature Deaths across the East Coast in comparison to OH", which needs a little adjustment.
- Neeti Shirke "Investigating Contributing Factors to HIV Prevalence" which is also a bit ambitious, but that can be OK if you avoid making causal statements based on cross-sectional aggregated data.
- Ria Tilve "Health and Socioeconomic Factors in Counties in States with the Best Hospitals"
- Jay Wei "How is number of mental health providers in the population, unemployment rate, number of poor mental health days, and percentage of the population that frequently feels mentally distressed related to suicide rate?" which is way too long.
- Olivia Wilcox "Health Factors Associated with Teen Births"
- Sneha Yamsani "How is Life Expectancy Effected Working in a Biotech Hub?" where I'm not happy with the use of the word "effected"
- Jiayue Yang, who needs a real title

We did not receive an early project proposal from these 16 people:

- Graham Akeson, Paula Ambrose, Abhishek Bhardwaj, Sid Dugar, (Ava) Cong Fan
- Aaron Fletcher, Scarlett He, Fumi Kong, Anna Magoline, Steven Mayher
- Drake McFaul, Raunak Nair, Cyrus Nosrati, Tyler Petrie, Jacob Rich
- or Tianze Wang
