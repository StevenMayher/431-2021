## Today's Slides

- There are no slides for today's class. 
- Instead, we'll discuss an Example about States and Counties, for which we have [this R Markdown file](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class13/statesandcounties.Rmd) and [this HTML result](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/states-counties-431-example).
- The recording will be made available approximately 24 hours after class through our Shared Google Drive and via Modules and Echo 360 on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 13](https://bit.ly/431-2021-minute-13) due tomorrow (Wednesday 2021-10-06) at noon.
2. Lab 3 results and feedback are available now on the [Course Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades).
    - Some Sample Plots, Code and Essays from Questions 4, 6 and 10 on Lab 3 that we liked are available to you on our Shared Google Drive in the **431 Lab 3 Examples** document.
    - We tweaked the response to Question 6 on the Sketch last night to include the `state`.
3. Project A Early Proposals are under review, and are almost complete now. Look for results on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu). Here are [some thoughts on a few elements of the submissions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class13/projectAearly.md).
4. Quiz 1 results and feedback.
    - Here is the [PDF of Quiz 1 Results](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/quizzes/quiz1). This includes complete answers to all items, along with results for the class by item and overall. Please review this document closely.
    - You should have heard from me twice last night via email, first with the rough contours of your performance on the Quiz, and then a separate email with an individual report of points scored on each item. Contact me by email if you're missing any of this information.
