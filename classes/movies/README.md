# Favorite Movies

On our Shared Google Drive in the `favorite_movies` subfolder, you'll find a data set (a Google Sheet called `movies_2021`) containing the 115 films that people taking either the 2020 and 2021 versions of 431 identified as their "Favorite Movies" in response to [the Syllabus, Section 18](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/movies.html). For each movie, I gathered several additional characteristics from the [Internet Movie Data Base](https://www.imdb.com/) (IMDB).

The data set is called `movies_2021`.

- [Here is a list of the 115 films](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/movies_list.md) in alphabetical order, with links to their IMDB pages.
- [Here is a brief codebook](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/movies_codebook.md) describing the variables presented in the currently available version of the `movies_2021` file.
