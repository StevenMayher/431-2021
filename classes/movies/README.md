# Favorite Movies

On our Shared Google Drive in the `favorite_movies` subfolder, you'll find a data set (a Google Sheet called `movies_2021`) containing the 115 films that people taking either the 2020 and 2021 versions of 431 identified as their "Favorite Movies" in response to [the Syllabus, Section 18](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/movies.html). For each movie, I gathered several additional characteristics from the [Internet Movie Data Base](https://www.imdb.com/) (IMDB).

The data set is called `movies_2021`.

- [Here is a list of the 115 films](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/movies_list.md) in alphabetical order, with links to their IMDB pages.
    - One thing I'll be doing over the next few class sessions is trying to identify how many of you have seen each of these films. My first attempt at that (covering movies 1-20 on the list) is part of the [Minute Paper after Class 7 due on Wednesday 2021-09-15 at noon](https://bit.ly/431-2021-minute-07).
- [Here is a brief codebook](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/movies_codebook.md) describing the variables presented in the currently available version of the `movies_2021` file.

We'll discuss this further in Class 08.
