# Favorite Movies

On our Shared Google Drive in the `favorite_movies` subfolder, you'll find a data set (a Google Sheet called `movies_2021`) containing the 115 films that people taking either the 2020 and 2021 versions of 431 identified as their "Favorite Movies" in response to [the Syllabus, Section 18](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/movies.html). For each movie, I gathered several additional characteristics from the [Internet Movie Data Base](https://www.imdb.com/) (IMDB).

## Activities involving the Movies Data

1. Here's the link for our [first breakout activity](breakout1.md), which we'll do in Class 08 (2021-09-16). And here are the [results from that activity](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/results1.md).

2. Here's the link for our [second breakout activity](breakout2.md), which we'll do in Class 12 (2021-09-29). And here are the [results from that activity](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/results2.md).

## New and Amplified Data Set

On 2021-10-16, I posted to our Shared Google Drive a new file called [431_favorite_movies_2021-10-16](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t4668vGN-97284uWbH154LQHmj8p90hkIlafPOjnIcQ/edit?usp=sharing)

This file is a Google Sheet with two tabs, representing my efforts to create a more comprehensive data set, in light of the results of our second breakout activity.

- The **movies_2021-10-16** tab includes 115 movies, and 69 variables.
- The **codebook** tab provides a description of each of the 69 variables.

## Original Data Set

The original version of the data set is called `movies_2021`.

- [Here is a list of the 115 films](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/movies_list.md) in alphabetical order, with links to their IMDB pages.
- [Here is a brief codebook](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/movies_codebook.md) describing the variables presented in the currently available version of the `movies_2021` file.
- I did some exploratory analyses on 2021-09-21. The HTML link is https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/movies-eda-1, and [the R Markdown document](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/movies_eda1.Rmd) is here.
