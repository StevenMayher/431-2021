# Favorite Movies: Breakout Activity 1

To be completed on 2021-09-16 (Class 08).

Form a group of 3-5 people. You'll be reporting the results of your work using the google form found at http://bit.ly/431-2021-movies-1. One person in your group should fill out the form.

In brief, you'll ...

1. Identify **two** exploratory questions about films in this sample that could be addressed using the five key variables (`year`, `imdb_categories`, `imdb_ratings`, `imdb_stars` and `length`) in [the current version of the movies data](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2020/blob/master/classes/movies/data/movies_2020-09-10.csv).
    - A good question (a) explores relationships involving two or more variables from the data set (b) lets us use data from all (or almost all) of the films and (c) ends with a question mark.
    - As an example that fits at least (a) and (c), we might ask "Do dramas last longer than comedy films?" which could be answered using the `length` and `imdb_categories` variables, although (b) is a problem since some films are not listed as either Drama or Comedy.

2. Look at the list of films. Alphabetically, what is the first film (i.e., lowest id value) that all of the members of your breakout group have seen? Write in the name of the film. If there isn't a film on the list that you've all seen, write in "We couldn't find one."
