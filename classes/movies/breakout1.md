# Favorite Movies: Breakout Activity 1

To be completed on 2021-09-16 (Class 08).

Form a group of 3-5 people. You'll be reporting the results of your work using the google form found at http://bit.ly/431-2021-movies-1. One person in your group should fill out the form.

## The Five Variables We're Focusing On Today

The data set is called `movies_2021` and describes 115 films mentioned as "favorites" by students in 431 for Fall 2020 or Fall 2021.

Variable | Sample Value | Explanation
:--------: | :------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------
`year` | 2019 | year film was released
`length` | 181 | length of film (in minutes)
`imdb_categories` | Action, Adventure, Drama | Film Categories specified by IMDB (up to 3)
`imdb_ratings` | 919813 | Number of Star Ratings (IMDB) as of 2021-09-10
`imdb_stars` | 8.4 | Weighted Average Rating (IMDB) as of 2021-09-10

## Your Task(s) for Today

In brief, you'll ...

1. Identify **two** exploratory questions about films in this sample that could be addressed using the five key variables (`year`, `imdb_categories`, `imdb_ratings`, `imdb_stars` and `length`) listed above in the current version of the movies data.
    - The current version (dated 2021-09-10) of the movies data is available on our Shared Google Drive, and is also available here.
    - Here is the [full codebook that explains what the other variables in the data mean](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/movies_codebook.md) but for today, we're sticking to the five variables listed above.
    - A good question (a) explores relationships involving two or more variables from the data set (b) lets us use data from all (or almost all) of the films and (c) ends with a question mark.
    - As an example that fits at least (a) and (c), we might ask "Do dramas last longer than comedy films?" which could be answered using the `length` and `imdb_categories` variables, although (b) is a problem since some films are not listed as either Drama or Comedy.

2. Look at the [list of films](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/movies/movies_list.md). Alphabetically, what is the first film (i.e., lowest `film_id` value) that **all** of the members of your breakout group have seen? Write in the name of the film. If there isn't a film on the list that you've all seen, you'll type in "We couldn't find one."
