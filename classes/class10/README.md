## Today's Slides

- Dr. Love's slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class10/431-class10-slides.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class10/431-class10-slides.Rmd).
- The recording will be made available approximately 24 hours after class through our Shared Google Drive and via Modules and Echo 360 on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Announcements

1. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 09 [is available now](https://bit.ly/431-2021-min9-feedback).
2. We will return to the [movies example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/classes/movies) on Tuesday, in Class 11.
    - I posed a Favorite Movies little poll on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431), which I hope you'll consider responding to for a little class participation credit, especially those of you who haven't previously engaged with Piazza. The poll closes Saturday at 10 AM, I believe. Thanks to those of you who've voted already.
3. Also in Class 11, we'll spend some time thinking about visualizing categorical data and assessing associations between categorical variables. I've adjusted the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) to reflect this adjustment.
4. You're always welcome to ask anything, so long as you're willing to accept the potential answer "I'm sorry - I cannot help with this."

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/labs/lab03/lab03.md) is due Monday 2021-09-27 at 9 PM. 
    - A hint is to think about missing data, even if we haven't explicitly asked you to do so.
2. If you want us to do an early review on your [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/) Proposal, you must submit it to Canvas by noon on Friday 2021-10-01.
    - The actual Proposal is due 2021-10-11, but if you submit by the deadline above, we'll review it and return it by 2021-10-06 so you can maximize your chances of getting through it in just one pass.
    - Part of the reason to do this is that it provides an excellent set of examples to be familiar with when you take Quiz 1.
    - If you haven't read all of the [Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/), now is the time to do so.
4. Additional Reading: Spiegelhalter Chapter 4 (What Causes What?) and perhaps also [IMS](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) Chapters 4-7 on Exploratory Data Analysis.
5. [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/quizzes) arrives on Friday 2021-10-01, and is due at 9 PM on Monday 2021-10-04.

## One Last Thing

[12 Resolutions for Grad Students](https://matt.might.net/articles/grad-student-resolutions/) from Matt Might at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

The whole list is potentially helpful, and Matt has more to say about each of them, but I'll emphasize the following...

- Practice writing
    - Effective public communication is critical to success as an academic.
    - There are never enough opportunities to write.
- Embrace the uncomfortable
    - The "Rule of 3" - when a third person recommends you try something, you must try it.
    - The "15 Minute Rule" - give something (like a TV show) the benefit of the doubt for 15 minutes. If you don't want to continue after that, drop it.
- Upgrade your tools
    - Are there shortcut keys you can learn in RStudio? Yep - look at Tools ... Keyboard Shortcuts Help
    - Are you familiar with the [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/)?
- Update your CV and web site 
    - If you cannot be googled, you don't exist.
    - Anything that is on your computer but not in the world is inherently less than the things you have sent into the world.   
    - ([Lab X](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/labX), when posted, will give you some motivation.)
- Network
    - What opportunities can you make to make connections with people who can help you, or who you can help?
- Say thanks
    - Unprompted civility goes a long way in academia and elsewhere. 
- Stay healthy
    - Constant pressure from high-stress milestones like qualifiers, proposals, defenses and paper submission deadlines don't promote healthy habits.
    - It's OK to get depressed. It's not OK to do nothing about it.
