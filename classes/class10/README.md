## Today's Slides

- Dr. Love's slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class10/431-class10-slides.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class10/431-class10-slides.Rmd).
- The recording will be made available approximately 24 hours after class through our Shared Google Drive and via Modules and Echo 360 on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).

## Announcements

1. Feedback on the Minute Paper after Class 09 [is available now](https://bit.ly/431-2021-min9-feedback).
2. We will return to the [movies example](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/classes/movies) on Tuesday, in Class 11.
    - I posed a Favorite Movies little poll on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431), which I hope you'll consider responding to for a little class participation credit, especially those of you who haven't previously engaged with Piazza. The poll closes Saturday at 10 AM, I believe. Thanks to those of you who've voted already.
3. Also in Class 11, we'll spend some time thinking about visualizing categorical data and assessing associations between categorical variables. I've adjusted the [Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) to reflect this adjustment.
4. You're always welcome to ask anything, so long as you're willing to accept the potential answer "I'm sorry - I cannot help with this."

## What Should I Be Working On?

1. [Lab 3](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/labs/lab03/lab03.md) is due Monday 2021-09-27 at 9 PM. 
    - A hint is to think about missing data, even if we haven't explicitly asked you to do so.
2. If you want us to do an early review on your [Project A](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/) Proposal, you must submit it to Canvas by noon on Friday 2021-10-01.
    - The actual Proposal is due 2021-10-11, but if you submit by the deadline above, we'll review it and return it by 2021-10-06 so you can maximize your chances of getting through it in just one pass.
    - Part of the reason to do this is that it provides an excellent set of examples to be familiar with when you take Quiz 1.
    - If you haven't read all of the [Project A instructions](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/), now is the time to do so.
4. Additional Reading: Spiegelhalter Chapter 4 (What Causes What?) and perhaps also [IMS](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) Chapters 4-7 on Exploratory Data Analysis.
5. [Quiz 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/quizzes) arrives on Friday 2021-10-01, and is due at 9 PM on Monday 2021-10-04.
