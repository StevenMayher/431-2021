## One Last Thing

Ellie Murray has an [interesting thread here on how pandemics end](https://twitter.com/epiellie/status/1444088804961304581?s=11). She starts with ...

> Everyone keeps talking about covid becoming endemic, but as I listen to the conversation, itâ€™s becoming more & more clear to me that very few of you know what "endemic" means. 

She goes on to discuss, in the context of COVID-19, the four options that we as a society are faced with at the beginning of any pandemic.

1. continually occurring disease, with small or large surges
2. local elimination of disease
3. global eradication of disease
4. complete extinction of the pathogen

I found the thread helpful to boosting my understanding.
