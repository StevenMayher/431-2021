## Announcements

1. I have posted [Chapters 16-25 of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/), which demonstrate fundamental ideas in comparing summaries (mostly means and proportions) across samples from populations or processes.

    - There will be a **Minute Paper after Class 15**. Details to come.

1. continually occurring disease, with small or large surges
2. local elimination of disease
3. global eradication of disease
4. complete extinction of the pathogen

I found the thread helpful to boosting my understanding.
