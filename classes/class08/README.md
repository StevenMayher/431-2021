## More to come.

1. Here's a link to the [readxl package description](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/). While `readxl` is installed when you install the tidyverse, it's not part of the core tidyverse packages loaded with `library(tidyverse)` so you have to load it on its own with `library(readxl)`.
    - The core packages in the `tidyverse` that load when you run `library(tidyverse)` are `[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)`, `[dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)`, `[tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)`, `[readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/)`, `[purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/)`, `[tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/)`, `[stringr](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)` and `[forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/)`.
    - When you *install* the `tidyverse` package, that also installs many additional non-core packages that need to be loaded on their own. These include: `[readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org/)`, `[googlesheets4](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/)`, `[haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/)`, `[lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/)`, `[magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/)` and `[glue](https://github.com/tidyverse/glue)` plus many more packages that I don't think we'll use this term.
    - Visit [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) for more details on the uses of these packages.
