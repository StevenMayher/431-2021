## Announcements

1. Grades and feedback on [Lab 7](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/lab07) are now available on the [Course Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades). 
    - See above for details on the [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-2021-lab-regrade-requests) for any of Labs 1-7.
    - We posted four nice essays written in response to Question 8 on our Shared Drive in the 431 Lab 7 Examples document. I encourage you to read them.
2. Here's a list of [favorite songs of students in 431](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/projectB/songs.md).
3. Today, we're discussing (among other things) multiple imputation in R using the `mice` package. You may be interested in some additional reading on this subject, especially since I don't have much to say about multiple imputation in the 431 Course Notes.
    - [Getting Started with Multiple Imputation in R](https://data.library.virginia.edu/getting-started-with-multiple-imputation-in-r/) by Aycan Katitas at the University of Virginia from 2019 is a nice starting point.
    - [mice: Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations in R](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v045i03) by Stef van Buuren and Karin Groothuis-Oudshoorn in the *Journal of Statistical Software* is a key academic reference.
    - [How Do I perform multiple imputation using predictive mean matching in R?](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/faq/how-do-i-perform-multiple-imputation-using-predictive-mean-matching-in-r/) from the UCLA Statistical Consulting group is quite helpful.
    - [Imputing missing data with R; MICE package](https://datascienceplus.com/imputing-missing-data-with-r-mice-package/) by Michy Alice in 2015, then updated in 2018 may also be helpful for you.
    - A brief tutorial on [Handling missing data with MICE package; a simple approach](https://datascienceplus.com/handling-missing-data-with-mice-package-a-simple-approach/) from DataScience+ in 2017.
