## Announcements

1. There is a [Minute Paper after Class 18](https://bit.ly/431-2021-minute-18) due Wednesday 2021-10-27 at Noon. Please complete it on time.
2. The [Lab 5 Answer Sketch](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/tree/main/labs/lab05/sketch) was lightly revised on Monday to show what would happen in Question 5 if you set up your factor so that the bootstrap is estimating *non-metro minus metro*, instead of the *metro minus non-metro* approach we anticipated you using. A similar issue crops up in Quiz 2, and we'll give full marks either way when completing that grading. 
    - Grades and feedback on Lab 5 are now available on the [Course Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades).
    - Remember that your lowest single Lab grade (of Labs 1-7) will be dropped when we calculate your Lab grade.
3. Quiz 2 was due at 11 PM Monday. Details to come.
4. Dr. Love has pushed back the deadline for the [Project A Portfolio](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-projectA/) 24 hours, so it is now due on Tuesday 2021-11-02 at 9 PM. 
    - We did this just to ensure that everyone gets their portfolio in on time. 
    - The Final Portfolio submission link is now on [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu).
    - Although there are no Tuesday TA office hours, Piazza is open for any last-minute questions.
5. Instructions for Project B will be posted as soon as possible.

## One Last Thing

To come.
