# Alice Room Mural Folklore

(thanks to Graham Akeson)

In one of the minute papers, the Alice Mural came up. The folklore that surrounds it is as follows:

It was painted in the early 2010s by a group of medical students. The school of medicine received feedback that the facility was dreary, depressing, and uninspiring. In order to combat this, the school solicited ideas. Since "demolish the building" and "put in some windows" were not feasible, the school elected to designate the space for a mural. In an effort to contain costs, medical students were asked to paint the mural. I do not know the names of the students who painted it.

The subject matter is the wonder, struggle, and disorientation of undergraduate medical education. The leftmost panel depicts the constant barrage of new information and critical "to dos." The red queen figure is a caricature of Dr. McKinley, a society dean at the time, the hatter represents Dr. Ricannati, a current dean. The central panel of the forest with specialties shows the struggle to choose a specialty when you don't know enough to make a meaningful distinction. The cheshire cat figure represents Dr. Haney, another society dean. The next one over has to do with the fluidity and scarcity of time while in medical school - emergencies happen quickly, in the midst of slow boring days. The rightmost panel shows the experience of empathizing with patients, especially in the context of their mortality, most commonly encountered during anatomy labs - hence the lack of skin.
