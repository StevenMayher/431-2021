## This will be a pre-recorded class. Details to come.

In this session, Dr. Love will provide a recording of himself using R and RStudio to:

- create a Project in RStudio
- create an R Markdown document to obtain and describe results
- ingest a data set from the wild into an R data frame
- manage that data frame so that it becomes a tidy tibble
- use that tibble to learn about the data by iterating through
  - visualizing the data
  - transforming the data
  - modeling the data (with a few simple summaries)
- interspersing code and text in my R Markdown document
- "knitting" my R Markdown document into an attractive HTML result

All materials will be posted as soon as possible.
