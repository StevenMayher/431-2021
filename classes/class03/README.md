# 431 Class 03: 2021-08-31

- This is the README for Class 03 of Professor Love's 431 course for Fall 2021. The main website is https://thomaselove.github.io/431/. Get here through the link on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).

## This will be a pre-recorded class. Details to come.

In this session, Dr. Love will provide a recording of himself using R and RStudio to:

- create a Project in RStudio
- create an R Markdown document to obtain and describe results
- ingest a data set from the wild into an R data frame
- manage that data frame so that it becomes a tidy tibble
- use that tibble to learn about the data by iterating through
  - visualizing the data
  - transforming the data
  - modeling the data (with a few simple summaries)
- interspersing code and text in my R Markdown document
- "knitting" my R Markdown document into an attractive HTML result

All materials will be posted late on Sunday 2021-08-29.

## The Materials

- The [431-r-template.Rmd](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class03/431-first-r-template.Rmd) file I'll start with (this is also available as part of [our 431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data)).
    - Be sure to click Raw to download the plain text version if that's what you want.
- The [quick_survey_2021.csv](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class03/data/quick_survey_2021.csv) file containing the data we'll use (this is also available as part of [our 431-data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data))
    - Again, be sure to click Raw to download the file if you're not pulling it from the 431-data page.
- The [431-class03-results.Rmd](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/classes/class03/431-class03-results.Rmd) file that shows the final version of the R Markdown file created during the recorded session.
- The HTML version of the document (after knitting the R Markdown) can be viewed at http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/class03-results-431.
