This is the Fall 2021 repository for PQHS / CRSP / MPHP 431 at Case Western Reserve University with Thomas E. Love, Ph.D.

## Note for Prospective Students

### Registration

Thank you for your interest in the 431 course for next Fall. 431 is the first in a two-semester course sequence, and most students will take 431 in the Fall and 432 in the Spring. Until further notice, we plan for the course to be held in person, rather than online, but we will review this decision in July and again in August. Of course, we will comply with all recommendations and requirements of the University, which may change at any time. The schedule will be Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 PM to 2:15 PM.

- If you are a student in the Clinical Research Scholars Certificate, MS or PhD program, you will want to register for CRSP 431.
- If you are a student in the Masters of Public Health program, you will want to register for MPHP 431.
- All other students, including non-degree students, should register for PQHS 431.
- The three "flavors" of 431 are otherwise identical.

**All** students at CWRU are welcome to take the course. Dr. Love will, in time, respond to student requests made through the student information system (SIS). 

- Students who request permission prior to July 6 will be granted permission to enroll in the course, no later than July 6. 
- Students requesting permission later than July 6 will be admitted to the course until we reach capacity. 
    - Students admitted to degree programs in the Department of Population & Quantitative Health Sciences will receive highest priority for admission. 
    - Students planning to take both 431 and 432 in the 2021-22 cycle will also receive higher priority than students planning only to take 431.
- Dr. Love does not allow students to audit any of his courses.
- Dr. Love does allow students in degree programs where the course would be an overload to take 431 (and 432) as a fellowship course.
- Students in the PQHS department wishing to waive 431 are welcome to discuss that with their advisor, but should consider whether [serving as a volunteer teaching assistant](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021#note-for-prospective-teaching-assistants) for the course would be in their best interest.

### Detailed Materials will appear in mid-July 2021

Dr. Love will begin to (a) think seriously about and (b) post syllabus and other materials for the course in July 2021. If you have questions about the course in the meantime, you can reach him by email at `thomas dot love at case dot edu`.

- The course includes many modern ideas for practical work in both statistics and data science, and thus involves considerable programming. 
- The 431-432 sequence teaches students how to use [R](https://cran.case.edu/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for data science. Although no prior experience with these tools is required, it is definitely helpful. We recommend the following starting points highly:
    - [RStudio Education's Beginners Page](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/)
    - [ModernDive: Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/index.html), in particular, sections 1-4.
    - [RStudio Cloud Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), especially "The Basics", "Work With Data", "Visualize Data" and "Tidy Your Data"
- Dr. Love will provide more detailed suggestions in mid-July for those who would like to improve their skills prior to the start of the course. Dr. Love will email all registered students in mid-July when these more detailed materials start to become available.

### Tentative Calendar

Scheduled class sessions are on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 to 2:15 PM Eastern time. I expect classes will be held on **24** of the 26 dates listed below. A final schedule should be available in mid-August.

- Note that 431 will not be held on 2021-10-19 or 2021-10-21 (CWRU fall break, and Dr. Love at AHRQ study section) or during Thanksgiving Week (2021-11-23 or 2021-11-25), even though other CWRU classes may meet on some of those dates. 
- We anticipate student final project presentations will take place on 2021-12-06, 2021-12-07 and 2021-12-09, with a detailed schedule made available in early November. Students should anticipate the need to remain in Cleveland through at least 2021-12-09 for this course.
- All work for 431 (including the final exam and all final project materials) will be completed by noon on Monday 2021-12-13.

## Note for Prospective Teaching Assistants

Please visit http://bit.ly/ta-positions-431-2021 for information on how to apply for either a (compensated or volunteer) teaching assistantship with Dr. Thomas Love this fall to work on the new version of PQHS/CRSP/MPHP 431. Commitments range from 6 to 20 hours per week.

Come help other students to learn R, R Studio, R Markdown, and statistical thinking! Improve your own skills! Learn new things! Make sure you're ready for comprehensive exams! Develop your CV, website and teaching portfolio! 

We'd love to hear from you if you're interested. The initial deadline for a reply is **July 19, 2021** at 5 PM although Dr. Love will consider additional applications as slots remain up until mid-August. 

Thanks for considering this, and I hope you're planning a delightful summer and making the world a little bit better. Please let me know if you have any questions, and make good choices.
