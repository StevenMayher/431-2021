## For Prospective Teaching Assistants

Please visit http://bit.ly/ta-positions-431-2021 for information on how to apply for a volunteer teaching assistantship (the compensated positions are now filled) with Dr. Thomas Love this fall to work on the new version of PQHS/CRSP/MPHP 431. Commitments average 6.5 hours per week.

Come help other students to learn R, R Studio, R Markdown, and statistical thinking! Improve your own skills! Learn new things! Make sure you're ready for comprehensive exams! Develop your CV, website and teaching portfolio! 

We'd love to hear from you if you're interested. Dr. Love will consider additional volunteers until the start of the semester. 

Thanks for considering this, and I hope you're planning a delightful summer and making the world a little bit better. Please let me know if you have any questions, and make good choices.
