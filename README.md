# 431-2021

This is the Fall 2021 repository for PQHS / CRSP / MPHP 431 at Case Western Reserve University with Thomas E. Love, Ph.D.

- [For Prospective Students](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021#notes-for-prospective-students)
- [For Prospective Teaching Assistants](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021#for-prospective-teaching-assistants)

## Notes for Prospective Students

### Registration

Thank you for your interest in the 431 course for next Fall. 431 is the first in a two-semester course sequence, and most students will take 431 in the Fall and 432 in the Spring. Until further notice, we plan for the course to be held in person, rather than online, but we will review this decision again in August. Of course, we will comply with all recommendations and requirements of the University, which may change at any time. The schedule will be Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 PM to 2:15 PM.

- If you are a student in the Clinical Research Scholars Certificate, MS or PhD program, you will want to register for CRSP 431.
- If you are a student in the Masters of Public Health program, you will want to register for MPHP 431.
- All other students, including non-degree students, should register for PQHS 431.
- The three "flavors" of 431 are otherwise identical.

## The Waiting List: Will I Be Able to Take the Course This Fall?

While all CWRU students are welcome to take the course, our class size will be restricted to **55** students in Fall 2021. Based on prior demand, some people who want to take the course **will not** be able to enroll this Fall. To alleviate this problem in the future, we plan to run multiple sections of the course starting in Fall 2022.

- Some students have already been admitted to the course by Dr. Love.
- Additional requests for enrollment made through the Student Information System (SIS) will be reviewed by Dr. Love as they come in, and decisions will be made in mid-August regarding permissions.
    - Students admitted to degree programs in the Department of Population & Quantitative Health Sciences will be permitted in.
    - All other students attempting to register will be wait-listed until 2021-08-10 when we will gauge how many can be permitted.
    - Students planning to take both 431 and 432 in the 2021-22 cycle will receive higher priority than students planning only to take 431. 
    - If you have been placed on the waiting list, please feel free to write a short email to Dr. Love if you are interested in letting him know more about your situation, in particular, if you are hoping to take both 431 and 432 this year.
- All students who wish to take the course must submit a request for enrollment prior to the first class (on 2021-08-24) via SIS.
- Dr. Love does not allow students to audit any of his courses.
- Dr. Love does allow students in degree programs where the course would be an overload to take 431 (and 432) as a fellowship course.
- Students in the PQHS department wishing to waive 431 should discuss that with their advisor and with Dr. Love (in July or August), and should consider whether [serving as a volunteer teaching assistant](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021#note-for-prospective-teaching-assistants) would be in their best interest.

### Detailed Materials will begin to appear in late July 2021

Dr. Love will begin to post syllabus and other materials for the course in late July 2021. If you have questions about the course in the meantime, you can reach him by email at `thomas dot love at case dot edu`.

- The course includes many modern ideas for practical work in both statistics and data science, and thus involves considerable programming. 
- The 431-432 sequence teaches students how to use [R](https://cran.case.edu/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for data science. Although no prior experience with these tools is required, it is definitely helpful. We recommend the following starting points highly:
    - [RStudio Education's Beginners Page](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/)
    - [ModernDive: Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/index.html), in particular, sections 1-4.
    - [RStudio Cloud Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), especially "The Basics", "Work With Data", "Visualize Data" and "Tidy Your Data"
- Dr. Love will provide more detailed suggestions in late July for those who would like to improve their skills prior to the start of the course. Dr. Love will email all registered students in late July when these more detailed materials start to become available.
    - During the course, we will read David Spiegelhalter's **The Art of Statistics** which was first published by Penguin in March 2019 in the UK and then by Basic Books in the US in September 2019. You can purchase either version online or in your local bookstore for about $20. More details on the book are available at [Dr. Spiegelhalter's website](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~david/). You are welcome to read the book before class starts, if you'd like to get a jump on things, but we'll link readings to the syllabus when that becomes available.

### Tentative Calendar

Scheduled class sessions are on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 to 2:15 PM Eastern time. I expect classes will be held on almost all of the 27 dates listed below. A final schedule should be available by the first class session on August 24. 

Month | Dates

2021-12 | 02

- Note that 431 will not be held on 2021-10-19 or 2021-10-21 (CWRU fall break, and Dr. Love at AHRQ study section) or during Thanksgiving Week (2021-11-23 or 2021-11-25), even though other CWRU classes may meet on some of those dates. 
- We anticipate student final project presentations will take place on 2021-12-06, 2021-12-07 and 2021-12-09, with a detailed schedule made available in early November. Students should anticipate remaining in Northeast Ohio through 2021-12-09 for 431.
- All work for 431 (including the final exam and all final project materials) will be completed by noon on Monday 2021-12-13.

## For Prospective Teaching Assistants

Please visit http://bit.ly/ta-positions-431-2021 for information on how to apply for either a (compensated or volunteer) teaching assistantship with Dr. Thomas Love this fall to work on the new version of PQHS/CRSP/MPHP 431. Commitments range from 6 to 20 hours per week.

Come help other students to learn R, R Studio, R Markdown, and statistical thinking! Improve your own skills! Learn new things! Make sure you're ready for comprehensive exams! Develop your CV, website and teaching portfolio! 

We'd love to hear from you if you're interested. The initial deadline for a reply is **2021-07-19** at 5 PM although Dr. Love will consider additional applications as slots remain up until mid-August. 

Thanks for considering this, and I hope you're planning a delightful summer and making the world a little bit better. Please let me know if you have any questions, and make good choices.
