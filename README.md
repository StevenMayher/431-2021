# 431-2021

This is the Fall 2021 repository for PQHS / CRSP / MPHP 431 at Case Western Reserve University with Thomas E. Love, Ph.D.

## Note for Prospective Students

### Registration

Thank you for your interest in the 431 course for next Fall. 431 is the first in a two-semester course sequence, and most students will take 431 in the Fall and 432 in the Spring. Until further notice, we plan for the course to be held  in person, rather than online. The schedule will be Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 PM to 2:15 PM.

- If you are a student in the Clinical Research Scholars Certificate, MS or PhD program, you will want to register for CRSP 431.
- If you are a student in the Masters of Public Health program, you will want to register for MPHP 431.
- All other students, including non-degree students, should register for PQHS 431.
- The three "flavors" of 431 are otherwise identical.

**All** students at CWRU are welcome to take the course. Dr. Love will begin to approve student requests made through SIS by June 1. 

- All students who request permission prior to June 1 will be granted permission to enroll in the course at that time. 
- Students requesting permission later will be admitted to the course until we reach capacity. 
- After June 1, students admitted to degree programs in the Department of Population & Quantitative Health Sciences will receive highest priority for admission.
- Dr. Love does not allow students to audit any of his courses.
- Dr. Love does allow students in degree programs where the course would be an overload to take 431 (and 432) as a fellowship course.

### Detailed Materials will appear starting in July

Dr. Love will begin to (a) think seriously about and (b) post syllabus and other materials for the course in July 2021. If you have questions about the course in the meantime, you can reach him by email at `thomas dot love at case dot edu`.

- The course includes many modern ideas for practical work in both statistics and data science, and thus involves considerable programming. 
- The 431-432 sequence teaches students how to use [R](https://cran.case.edu/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [the tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) for data science. Although no prior experience with these tools is required, it is definitely helpful. We recommend the following starting points for people who want to get started over the summer...
    - [RStudio Education's Beginners Page](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/)
    - [ModernDive: Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/index.html), in particular, sections 1-4.
    - [RStudio Cloud Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) on "The Basics", "Work With Data", "Visualize Data" and "Tidy Your Data"
- Dr. Love will provide more detailed suggestions in July for those who would like to improve their skills prior to the start of the course. 

## Note for Prospective Teaching Assistants

Please email Dr. Love at `thomas dot love at case dot edu` if you are interested in becoming a (compensated or volunteer) teaching assistant for the 431 course in Fall 2021, expressing your interest. Use the subject line **TA for 431**. 

- In late May, Dr. Love will provide a link to application materials and additional details as they become available.
- Also in late May, he will provide that link to all students who have successfully completed the 431-432 sequence in the past three years, automatically.

Thank you.
