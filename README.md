- Note that 431 will not be held on 2021-10-19 or 2021-10-21 (CWRU fall break, and Dr. Love at AHRQ study section) or during Thanksgiving Week (2021-11-23 or 2021-11-25), even though other CWRU classes may meet on some of those dates. 
- We anticipate student final project presentations will take place on 2021-12-06, 2021-12-07 and 2021-12-09, with a detailed schedule made available in early November. Students should anticipate remaining in Northeast Ohio through 2021-12-09 for 431.
- All work for 431 (including the final exam and all final project materials) will be completed by noon on Monday 2021-12-13.

## For Prospective Teaching Assistants

Please visit http://bit.ly/ta-positions-431-2021 for information on how to apply for a volunteer teaching assistantship (the compensated positions are now filled) with Dr. Thomas Love this fall to work on the new version of PQHS/CRSP/MPHP 431. Commitments average 6.5 hours per week.

Come help other students to learn R, R Studio, R Markdown, and statistical thinking! Improve your own skills! Learn new things! Make sure you're ready for comprehensive exams! Develop your CV, website and teaching portfolio! 

We'd love to hear from you if you're interested. Dr. Love will consider additional volunteers until the start of the semester. 

Thanks for considering this, and I hope you're planning a delightful summer and making the world a little bit better. Please let me know if you have any questions, and make good choices.
