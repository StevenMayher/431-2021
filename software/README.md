# Software Tutorials and Examples for 431

## Getting Help

Use the [Contact Us](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/contact.html) page on our main website to find out about all the ways you can get help from us during the semester. We want to help you with your R problems!

## Installation

- Visit [the Install R page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/software_install.html) for information on installing R and RStudio.
- Visit [the R Packages page](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/r_packages.html) for details on the R packages we're using in 431.
- Download the data and code (functions) we've developed for the course from our [Data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data).

If you need more help, you might look at [this terrific resource for Installing R and RStudio](http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html) from Jenny Bryan and the STAT 545 project. These are the people responsible for the great [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/) project, which is worth your time, too, if you intend to use Git and GitHub for more than just downloading materials for the course.

## Getting Started with R, RStudio and R Markdown

Professor Love's document entitled **Getting Started with R** is a good first step. It demonstrates some of the details on how to use these tools to actually analyze data. 

- [Here is the R Markdown code](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/software/431-getting-started-with-R.Rmd) that produces the other materials. To download it, select Raw and download the result, or else grab it from our [Data Downloads page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data), following the instructions there.
- [Here is the downloadable PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/software/431-getting-started-with-R.pdf).
- [Here is an HTML file](https://rpubs.com/TELOVE/getting-started-2021) that the R Markdown code produces, if you'd like to see it.
- Here is the [431-first-r-template.Rmd](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/software/431-first-r-template.Rmd) file that Dr. Love refers to in the Getting Started with R materials. The template is also available on our [Data Downloads page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data).
- [The Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-notes/) are the primary source for R Examples we'll use this semester.

## Other Places to Learn about R, RStudio and R Markdown

The 431-432 sequence teaches students how to use R, RStudio, R Markdown and the tidyverse for data science. Although no prior experience with these tools is required, it is definitely helpful. We recommend the following starting points highly:

- [RStudio Education's Beginners Page](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/)
- RStudio's [incredibly useful Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) had a [major update announced on 2021-08-23](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/08/23/cheat-sheet-updates/). Many RStudio cheatsheets have been updated or reworked based on recent package updates.
- [ModernDive: Statistical Inference via Data Science](https://moderndive.com/index.html), in particular, sections 1-4.
- [RStudio Cloud Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers)
    - The tutorials we recommend most strongly here are: [The Basics](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1), [Work with Data](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/2), [Visualize Data](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/3) and [Tidy Your Data](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/4), all of which would be helpful to review before our first Quiz.
- There is an R package and set of tools called the [introverse](https://spielmanlab.github.io/introverse/articles/introverse_online.html) which is another way to get some help with basic ideas in R and the tidyverse that we'll be discussing through the semester.
- You can learn a fair amount to [get started with R with teacup giraffes](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/index.html), if you're looking for an interactive way to learn about some of the basics.
- If you're already a strong coder, and have some R experience, there are also [learning pathways for intermediates at RStudio Education](https://education.rstudio.com/learn/intermediate/) which might be appealing to you.

Our goal is to get everyone well into the intermediate level by December. Some people will get there in September, for others it will take longer. But you can do this, and we'll be there to help you.
