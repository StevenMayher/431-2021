# Quiz 1 

The files you will need to complete Quiz 1 are:

1. a PDF file containing all 25 questions and complete instructions
2. a link to the Google Form Answer Sheet for Quiz 1 (where you will submit all of your responses by the deadline)
3. three data files, which are available **now** in our Shared Google Drive in the Quiz 1 folder
    - the three files are called `fastfood.csv`, `oscar.csv` and `zips.csv`.

All materials will be posted above by 9 AM on 2021-10-01. The Quiz is due when [the Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html) says it is. No late work will be accepted, so do not wait until the last minute to enter your work in the Google Form and press Submit. You can edit your work on the Answer Sheet after you submit, up until the deadline. No responses outside of the Google Form Answer Sheet will be accepted.
