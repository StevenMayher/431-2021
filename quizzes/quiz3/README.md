## Quiz 3 Instructions

## Details

The files you will need to complete Quiz 3 include:

1. [a PDF file] containing all questions and complete instructions - the PDF file is 21 pages long. Be sure you have all 21 pages.
2. [the Google Form Answer Sheet for Quiz 3](https://bit.ly/431-2021-quiz3-answer-sheet) where you will submit your responses by the deadline.
3. the files (`Love-boost.R`, a script called `wc_code.R` and six data files) which are in our Shared Google Drive in the data subfolder within the Quiz 3 folder.

The Quiz contains 30 questions. All materials will be posted for the Quiz by Noon on Friday 2021-11-19. 

## Deadline

The Quiz is due on Monday 2021-11-29 (the Monday after Thanksgiving) at 9 PM. No exceptions.

## Getting Help

If you need clarification on a Quiz question, you have exactly two ways of getting help:

1. You can ask your question in a private post on Piazza to the instructors. (This is the only kind of post you will be able to make on Piazza during the Quiz.)
2. You can ask your question via email to 431-help at case dot edu. 

While the complete Quiz is available, we will not answer questions about the Quiz except through the two approaches listed above. We promise to respond to all questions received before 5 PM on Monday 2021-11-29 at that time, if not sooner.

Good luck!
