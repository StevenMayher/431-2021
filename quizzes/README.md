The "Instructions" for each Quiz will include:

- links to relevant data sets
- a PDF of the Quiz itself (which will also be posted to our shared google drive) containing 20-25 questions
- a link to the Answer Sheet for the Quiz (which is a Google Form, like the ones we use for the Minute Papers)

You must log into Google via CWRU to access the Answer Sheet and you must complete your submission of this Form no later than the posted deadline on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html). 

- No late work on Quizzes will be accepted. 
- All work will be graded based solely on your submitted Answer Sheet, which must be received by noon on the deadline day.
- When you submit the Answer Sheet, your responses will be emailed to your CWRU email address, along with a link to allow you to edit your work before the deadline.
- Dr. Love grades all Quizzes. 
- You will usually receive your Quiz grade along with a detailed Answer Sketch for all Quiz questions 48 hours after the submission deadline.

Additional information on Quizzes is provided in [this section of the Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/deliverables-assignments.html#quizzes) and we will also provide guidance regarding getting help and completing the Quiz forms as part of the Quiz instructions.

## Sample Quiz: Five Old Quiz Questions

Dr. Love prepared a document containing five old quiz questions, as well as an answer sketch for those five questions, and some information on results. 

- Here is [the PDF document containing the old questions, answer sketch and results](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/quizzes/quiz_sample/five-old-quiz-questions.pdf).
- Here is [the mitral.csv data set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/main/quizzes/quiz_sample/data/mitral.csv) referred to in Questions 2-4. It's also available on [our 431-data site](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-data).

This is for the benefit of students worried about Quiz 1 who wanted to understand what it might look like. It is a convenient sample of five old questions, and is **not** meant to be completely representative of what might be asked this year. We're not collecting responses on this set of questions, nor is it required that you even look at this document. If you have questions about this after reading the answer sketch at the end of the document, feel free to ask us.

## Getting Help during a Quiz

Again, all quizzes in 431 are **open book, open notes**. You are welcome to consult the materials provided on the course website and that we've been reading in the class, but you are not allowed to discuss the questions on this quiz with anyone other than Professor Love and the teaching assistants. You will be required to complete a short affirmation that you have obeyed these rules as part of submitting the Quiz.

If you need clarification on a Quiz question, you will have exactly two ways of getting help:

1. You can ask your question in a private post on Piazza to the instructors. (This is the only kind of post you will be able to make on Piazza during the Quiz.)
2. You can ask your question via email to **431-help at case dot edu**. This email is only open to you during the period after a Quiz has been released and before it is due.

For each Quiz, we will not answer questions about the Quiz except through the two approaches listed above. 

A few cautions:

- Specific questions are more likely to get helpful answers.
- We will not review your code or your English for you.
- We will not tell you if your answer is correct, or if it is complete.
- We will email all students if we find an error in the Quiz that needs fixing.

### When Should I ask for help?

We recommend the following process.

- If you encounter a tough question, skip it, and build up your confidence by tackling other questions.
- When you return to the tough question, spend no more than 10-15 minutes on it.
If you still don't have it, take a break (not just to do other questions) but an actual break.
- When you return to the question, it may be much clearer to you. If so, great. If not, spend 5-10 minutes on it, at most, and if you are still stuck, ask us for help.
- This is not to say that you cannot ask us sooner than this, but you should **never, ever** spend more than 20 minutes on any question without asking for help.
