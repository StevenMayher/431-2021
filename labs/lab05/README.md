# Lab 05 Materials

Instructions for Lab 05 are [available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/labs/lab05/lab05.md).

All deadlines for 431 work, including this Lab, are posted in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).

- For LAB 5 only, since we have extended the deadline 3 days, we will not accept any Lab 5 work that is more than 1 hour late (that is, that is submitted to Canvas after 9:59 PM on Thursday 2021-10-21.)
- If we find an error in your submission and ask you to resubmit, we'll give you until noon Friday 2021-10-22 to do so.

## After the Lab

- Answer Sketch and Grading Rubric for Lab 5 are now posted in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/labs/lab05/sketch/lab05_sketch.Rmd) and [also PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/labs/lab05/sketch/lab05_sketch.pdf).
  - We updated the response to Question 5 on 2021-10-25 to show what would happen in Question 5 if you set up your factor to compare non-metro minus metro, rather than the metro minus non-metro approach we used.
- Grades and Feedback on the Lab are available now on the [Course Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades).
  - We adjusted (upwards) the grades for some students on Question 9, where we'd mistakenly removed points for your construction of the 2x2 table, since there are two alternative approaches which are each appropriate. The affected students will see 2-4 extra points on this Lab on the [Course Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades).
