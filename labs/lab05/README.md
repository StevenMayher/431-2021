# Lab 05 Materials

Instructions for Lab 05 are [available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/labs/lab05/lab05.md).

All deadlines for 431 work, including this Lab, are posted in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).

## After the Lab

- Answer Sketch and Grading Rubric will be posted the day after the Lab is due.
- Grades on the Lab will be posted to the Course Grading Roster one week after the deadline for the Lab.
- Additional materials will be posted as necessary.
