# Lab 07 Materials

Instructions for Lab 07 [are available here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/labs/lab07/lab07.md).

All deadlines for 431 work, including this Lab, are posted in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).

- Labs that are turned in up to 12 hours after the deadline can receive up to 90% of available points.
- Labs turned in 12-72 hours after the deadline can receive up to 75% of available points **only if** the student has contacted Dr. Love via email to request this opportunity by 12 hours after the deadline. 
- Otherwise, we will not grade or give credit for late Labs.
