# Lab 01 Materials

Instructions for Lab 01 [are available here](lab01.md). We fixed a typo on 2021-09-06 at noon that is not going to change anyone's response.

All deadlines for 431 work, including this Lab, are posted in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).

## After the Lab

- Our draft answer sketch and grading rubric is now available [in pdf](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/labs/lab01/sketch/lab01_sketch.pdf) and [in R Markdown format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/labs/lab01/sketch/lab01_sketch.Rmd).
  - If we make any changes to this document during grading (which we usually do), we'll repost when we post the grades. If you find any errors or points of confusion, please let us know under the lab01 folder on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431).
- Grades on the Lab will be posted to the Course Grading Roster one week after the deadline for the Lab.
- Additional materials will be posted as necessary.
