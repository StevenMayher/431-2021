# Lab 01 Materials

Instructions for Lab 01 [are available here](lab01.md). We fixed a typo on 2021-09-06 at noon that is not going to change anyone's response.

All deadlines for 431 work, including this Lab, are posted in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).

## After the Lab

- Answer Sketch and Grading Rubric will be posted the day after the Lab is due.
- Grades on the Lab will be posted to the Course Grading Roster one week after the deadline for the Lab.
- Additional materials will be posted as necessary.
