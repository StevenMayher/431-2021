# Lab 01 Materials

Instructions for Lab 01 [are available here](lab01.md). We fixed a typo on 2021-09-06 at noon that is not going to change anyone's response.

All deadlines for 431 work, including this Lab, are posted in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html).

## After the Lab

- Our draft answer sketch and grading rubric is now available [in pdf](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/labs/lab01/sketch/lab01_sketch.pdf) and [in R Markdown format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2021/blob/main/labs/lab01/sketch/lab01_sketch.Rmd).
  - If we make any changes to this document during grading (which we usually do), we'll repost when we post the grades. If you find any errors or points of confusion, please let us know under the lab01 folder on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431).
- Grades on the Lab will be posted to the Course Grading Roster one week after the deadline for the Lab.
- Additional materials will be posted as necessary.

## Late Work

- Labs received after the deadline but before the answer sketch is published can receive up to 90% of available points.
- Lab submissions received after the answer sketch is published (noon on Tuesday 2021-09-07) but still within one week of the original deadline can receive up to 75% of available points.
- Lab submissions received more than one week after the deadline will not be graded.
