## After the Lab

  - If we make any changes to this document during grading (which we usually do), we'll repost when we post the grades. If you find any errors or points of confusion, please let us know under the lab02 folder on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/case/fall2021/pqhs431).

- Lab submissions received more than one week after the deadline will not be graded.
