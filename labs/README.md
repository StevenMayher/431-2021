## Grading

All labs are graded by the TAs and then reviewed by Dr. Love. Your grades will be available approximately one week after the deadline for each Lab. 

**Grades on Labs** (and our records about minute papers) will be found in the [Course Grading Roster](https://bit.ly/431-2021-grades) that will appear in September.

- You'll need to log into Google via CWRU to see your scores and the comments left there by the Teaching Assistants. 
- Your **Lab Code** identifies you in the roster. You will receive your Lab Code via email from Dr. Love in September. (The email's subject will be 431 Lab Code.) 

## Late Work?

All Labs should be turned in by the deadline specified on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html). We don't actually give extensions on Labs. Instead, we use the following grading policy.

- Labs that are turned in up to 12 hours after the deadline can receive up to 90% of available points.
- Labs turned in 12-72 hours after the deadline can receive up to 75% of available points **only if** the student has contacted Dr. Love via email to request this opportunity by 12 hours after the deadline. You need not explain why you need this extension.
- Labs turned in more than 72 hours after the deadline (or more than 12 hours after the deadline if you haven't contacted Dr. Love via email) will receive no credit.
- Your single lowest Lab grade (out of the first seven Labs) will be dropped before we calculate your Lab grade for the course. 

## Grading Errors and Regrade Requests

The [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-2021-lab-regrade-requests) is now available at https://bit.ly/431-2021-lab-regrade-requests. This is how we handle almost all grading errors and regrade requests on Labs. The only exception to this policy is when you believe we've made an arithmetic error in summing up your points on a lab. If that happens, just email Dr. Love to get it straightened out. The Form is used for all other regrade situations.

- Essentially, if you want Dr. Love to review your grade on one (or more) of our Labs, fill out the [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-2021-lab-regrade-requests) anytime before 2021-12-10 at noon, as specified on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html). 
- Shortly after December 10, when all course work has been graded, Dr. Love will open the form. If you have requested additional points that could change your course grade, he'll review your request. If not, then he won't. 
- Visit [this section of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2021-syllabus/deliverables-assignments.html#appeal-policy---request-a-review-in-december) for more details on this policy.
