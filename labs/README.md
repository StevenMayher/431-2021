## Grading

All labs are graded by the TAs and then reviewed by Dr. Love. Your grades will be available approximately one week after the deadline for each Lab. 

**Grades on Labs** (and our records about minute papers) will be found in the **Course Grading Roster** that will appear in September.

- You'll need to log into Google via CWRU to see your scores and the comments left there by the Teaching Assistants. 
- Your **Lab Code** identifies you in the roster. You will receive your Lab Code via email from Dr. Love in September. (The email's subject will be 431 Lab Code.) 

## Late Work?

All Labs should be turned in by the deadline specified on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html). We don't actually give extensions on Labs. Instead, we use the following grading policy.

- Labs that are turned in after the deadline but before the Answer Sketch for the Lab is posted (usually noon the next day) can receive up to 90% of available points.
- Labs turned in after the Answer Sketch is posted, but within one week of the deadline can receive up to 75% of available points.
- Labs turned in one week or later after the deadline will receive no credit.
- Your single lowest Lab grade (out of the first seven Labs) will be dropped before we calculate your Lab grade for the course. 

## Grading Errors and Regrade Requests

The **Lab Regrade Request Form** will be posted later in the semester. This is how we handle all grading errors and regrade requests on Labs. 

- Essentially, if you want Dr. Love to review your grade on one (or more) of our Labs, fill out the **Lab Regrade Request Form** anytime before 2021-12-10 at noon, as specified on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431/calendar.html). 
- In December, after all course work has been graded, Dr. Love will open the form. If you have requested additional points that could change your course grade, he'll review your request. If not, then he won't. 
- Visit **Section X.X.X of the Syllabus** for more details on this policy.
